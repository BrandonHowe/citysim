  "description": "Hi, and welcome to CitySim! This README should hopefully give you all the information you need about this project.  \r ## About this project  \r This project was partially a school project, partially something to do for fun. It revolves around designing a sustainable city.  \r You'll be able to do things like build roads, place buildings, edit their properties, and so forth. There will be many different types of buildings, such as Apartments, Offices, Hospitals, and more. You'll also have to manage the city's transportation systems in the form of pedestrians, taxicabs, and buses.  \r Naturally, you can't make an all-inclusive city - you have to specialize! If you're making a more industrialized city, that's great, but you probably won't have room for farms. Don't worry, you'll be able to tax your people and businesses in order to buy food. If you are making a farming oriented economy, you'll be more self sufficient, but your industrialization will reflect that. It's up to you!  \r ## Building list  \r |Building name|Status|Benefits|  \r |--|--|--|  \r |Apartment|Partially implemented|Provides housing|  \r |Office|Partially implemented|Your basic capitalist production center|  \r |Shop|Not implemented|Your citizens need items!|  \r |Power plant|Not implemented|Gives your city energy.
