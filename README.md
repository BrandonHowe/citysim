# CitySim
Hi, and welcome to CitySim! This README should hopefully give you all the information you need about this project.
## About this project
This project was partially a school project, partially something to do for fun. It revolves around designing a sustainable city.
You'll be able to do things like build roads, place buildings, edit their properties, and so forth. There will be many different types of buildings, such as Apartments, Offices, Hospitals, and more. You'll also have to manage the city's transportation systems in the form of pedestrians, taxicabs, and buses.
Naturally, you can't make an all-inclusive city - you have to specialize! If you're making a more industrialized city, that's great, but you probably won't have room for farms. Don't worry, you'll be able to tax your people and businesses in order to buy food. If you are making a farming oriented economy, you'll be more self sufficient, but your industrialization will reflect that. It's up to you!

## Citizens
Citizens, or POPs, represent your population units. These citizens have requirements, and also some variable numbers. They require a home, food, and entertainment. Naturally, these all can be paid for via money, which they get from a job. Food is the most important. If a citizen goes without food for too long, they will die. Death is the only way a POP can be removed. If a citizen is unable to pay for his home, then they will become homeless. Homelessness means that a citizen has a higher chance of injury, and an extraordinarily higher chance of becoming a victim of crime. Entertainment is more variable, as different activities can all provide varying levels of entertainment. If a citizen becomes too unhappy, they may become stressed or even depressed, which is bad for a citizen.
