# CitySim  
Hi, and welcome to CitySim! This README should hopefully give you all the information you need about this project.  
## About this project  
This project was partially a school project, partially something to do for fun. It revolves around designing a sustainable city.  
You'll be able to build and close buildings in order to lead your citizens to greatness. You can't choose what they do, but you can guide them on the path to success.
You can choose to make a city whose wealth lets people take baths in money and use coins as fridge magnets, but you probably won't grow your own food or use sustainable energy sources. Even if you choose to make less money, your sustainability score can go up in the long run if you decide to grow your own food and use renewable energy sources.
## Building list  
|Building name|Status|Benefits|  
|--|--|--|  
|Apartment|Partially implemented|Provides housing|  
|Office|Implemented|Your basic capitalist production center|  
|Power plant|Partially implemented|Gives your city energy. Will be discussed more later|    
|Farm|Partially imlemented|Produces food|  
  
As you can see, there is a myriad of different buildings. You'll need a balance of them to succeed!
